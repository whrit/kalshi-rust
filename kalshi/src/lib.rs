//! An HTTPS and Websocket wrapper that allows users to write trading bots for the [Kalshi events trading platform](https://kalshi.com).
//!
//! kalshi-rust is asynchronous, performant, and succint. Dash past verbose and annoying HTTPS requests
//! and use this wrapper to quickly write blazingly fast trading bots in Rust!
//!
//! As of version 0.9.0, HTTPS features are fully complete but websocket support and advanced API access features are not complete.
//! If you'd like to keep up on kalshi-rust's development, report bugs, or view a sample trading script,
//! feel free to visit the [github](https://github.com/dpeachpeach/kalshi-rust)!
//! A star would also be greatly appreciated, I'm a student developer writing this for free and any recognition is incredibly helpful!
//!
//! ## The Kalshi Struct
//!
//! The [Kalshi](Kalshi) struct is the central component of this crate.
//! All authentication, order routing, market requests, and position snapshots are handled through the struct and its methods.
//!
//! For more details, see [Kalshi](Kalshi).
//!
//! For a quick tutorial / beginners guide, jump [here](#quick-start-guide).
//!
//! ### Initializing the Kalshi struct in demo mode.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//!
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode, "your-key-id", "path/to/private.pem").await?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Quick Start Guide
//!
//! First, list the Kalshi struct as a dependency in your crate.
//!
//! ```toml
//! kalshi = { version = "0.9"}
//! ```
//!
//! Initialize the Kalshi Struct with key-based authentication:
//! - **IMPORTANT**:  The authentication is handled automatically when creating a new instance.
//! - Store your key ID and private key file securely, an implementation of extracting these from local environmental variables
//! is available [here](https://github.com/dpeachpeach/kalshi-rust/blob/main/sample_bot/src/main.rs#L12)
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//!
//! let key_id = "your-key-id";
//! let pem_path = "path/to/private.pem";
//!
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode, key_id, pem_path).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! After logging in, you can call any method present in the crate without issue.
//! Here is a script that buys a 'yes' contract on November 13th's New York temperature
//! market.
//!
//! ```
//! let new_york_ticker = "HIGHNY-23NOV13-T51".to_string();
//!
//! let bought_order = kalshi_instance
//!     .create_order(
//!     kalshi::Action::Buy,
//!     None,
//!     1,
//!     kalshi::Side::Yes,
//!     new_york_ticker,
//!     kalshi::OrderType::Limit,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     Some(5)).await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Refer to the rest of the documentation for details on all other methods!
//!
//! ## Returned Values
//!
//! Whenever a user makes a method call using the kalshi struct, data is typically returned
//! in structs that encapsulate the json fields returned by the server. All data
//! in the structs is owned so a user can access the attributes without issue.
//!
//! ### Examples:
//!
//! #### Obtaining the Exchange's current status
//! Returns a struct that represents whether trading or the exchange are currently active.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode, "your-key-id", "path/to/private.pem").await?;
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_exchange_status().await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! #### Obtaining 5 miscellaneous market events
//! Returns a vector of 'event' structs and a cursor.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode, "your-key-id", "path/to/private.pem").await?;
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_multiple_events(Some(5), None, None, None, None).await.unwrap();
//! ```
//! #### Checking the User's balance
//! Returns an i64 representing the user's balance in cents.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode, "your-key-id", "path/to/private.pem").await?;
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_balance();
//! ```
//!
